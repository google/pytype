Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at
the end).

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.


### Pytype dependencies
Before you can build and test Pytype, you will have to install a few
dependencies.

1. __A C++11 compiler for your platform__: Pytype uses extension modules.
   A C++11 compiler is required to build these extension modules.
2. __[CMake](https://cmake.org) version 2.8 or higher__: To build the extension
   modules and to run tests in parallel, Pytype makes use of a CMake based
   build system.
3. __[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) version 3.0.2 or higher__:
   Pytype uses a custom parser to parse PYI files. This parser is implemented
   using Flex and Bison.
4. __[Flex](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/) version 2.5.35 or higher__
5. __[ninja build](https://ninja-build.org/)__: Pytype's test utility scripts
   make use of ninja as the CMake generated build system.
6. __Python2.7 and Python3.6 Interpreters__: A large subset of Pytype's
   functional tests analyse the target (the Python source code that is being
   analyzed by Pytype) twice: once as if it were Python2.7 code, and another
   time as if it were Python3.6 code. Hence, to run these tests, you will need
   Python2.7 and Python3.6 interpreters installed on your system.

### Adding tests to your Changes
Ideally, every change should include a test. Depending on the type of your
change, you should either be adding a functional test or a unit test (some
changes might warrant both). Functional tests should be added in the
`pytype/tests` directory. Unit tests should be added in a test module next to
the module that is being tested.

Since Pytype already has exhaustive tests, a change will most likely need to
add a test method to an existing test module. In such a case, there is
nothing special required, other than just adding a new test method. If adding a
new test module is more meaningful, apart from adding the new test module, your
change should also add a `py_test` target to the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the
directory in which the test module lives. See existing `py_test` targets (in
`CMakeLists.txt` files) for examples on how to do this.

NOTE: Please see `pytype/tests/README.md` for more rules pertaining to adding
new functional tests.

### Running tests
There exists a convenience script to run Python tests. A typical usage of this
script is as follows:

```
$> python build_scripts/run_tests.py <MODULE_NAME>
```

`MODULE_NAME` is the fully qualified test module name within the root Pytype
source tree. If a module name is not specified, the script runs all the Python
tests for which `py_test` targets exist in the CMake files.

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one mentioned above; they're covered by the the Software Grant and
Corporate Contributor License Agreement.
