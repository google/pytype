## How is pytype different from other type checkers?

pytype has the ability to infer types for unannotated code. For more
information, check out:

* A [PyCon lightning talk][lightning-talk] comparing pytype and mypy,
another popular type checker. The slides are [here][lightning-talk-slides].
* A more detailed written discussion in a [Lobste.rs post][lobsters-comment].

## Can I find out what pytype thinks the type of my expression is?

Yes, insert `reveal_type(expr)` as a statement inside your code. This will cause
pytype to emit an error that will describe the type of `expr`.

## How do I reference a type from within its definition? (Forward References)

To reference a type from within its definition (e.g. when a method's return type
is an instance of the class to which the method belongs), specify the type as a
string. This will be resolved later by PyType. For example:

```python
class Person(object):
  def CreatePerson(name: str) -> 'Person':
    ...
```

## I'm dynamically populating a class / module using `setattr` or by modifying `locals()` / `globals()`. Now pytype complains about missing attributes or module members. How do I fix this?

Add `_HAS_DYNAMIC_ATTRIBUTES = True` to your class or module.

## Why didn't pytype catch that my program (might) pass an invalid argument to a function?

pytype accepts a function call if there's at least one argument combination that
works. For example,

```python
def f(x: float):
  return x
f(random.random() or "foo")
```

is not considered an error, because `f()` works for `float`. I.e., the `str`
argument isn't considered. (This might change at some point in the future) Note
that this is different to attribute checking, where e.g.

```python
(random.random() or "foo").as_integer_ratio()
```

will indeed result in a type error.

## How do I declare that something can be either byte string or unicode?

Using `typing.Text` if it is conceptually a text object,
`typing.Union[bytes, typing.Text]` otherwise. See the
[style guide][style-guide-string-types] for more information.

## Why is pytype taking so long?

If pytype is taking a long time on a file, the easiest workaround is to
[disable][how-do-i-disable-all-pytype-checks-for-a-particular-file] it with a
`skip-file` directive. Otherwise, there are two things you can try to speed up
the analysis:

* Annotate the return types of functions to speed up inference.
* Simplify function inputs (e.g., by reducing the number of types in unions) to
  speed up checking.

## How do I disable all pytype checks for a particular file?

You can use

```
# pytype: skip-file
```

at the start of the file to disable all checking for a particular file, while
still checking the rest of the blaze target that includes it.

## How do I disable all pytype checks for a particular import?

You can use

```python
from typing import Any
import foo  # type: Any
```

to disable checking for module `foo`. Note that pytype will still verify that
`foo` is present among your target's dependencies. To disable that check as
well, replace `# type: Any` with `# type: ignore`.

## How do I write code that is seen by pytype but ignored at runtime?

You can nest it inside an `if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:` block. This is occasionally
needed to, for instance,
[conditionally import a module][style-guide-conditional-imports] that is only
used to provide type annotations.

Note that regardless of whether you use `TYPE_CHECKING`, if you're using a build
system, you'll need to list all modules you import as dependencies of your
target. That can lead to cycles in your build graph. Typically, that means that,
short of rearranging your source tree, you won't be able to annotate with that
specific type. You can typically work around the "inexpressible" type by
inserting `Any` where you would have used it. See the
[style guide][style-guide-circular-dependencies] for more information.
