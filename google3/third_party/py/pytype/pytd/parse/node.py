"""Base node class used to represent immutable trees.

All node classes should be 'attr' classes inheriting from Node, which defines
field iteration and comparison methods.

For the concrete node types, see pytd/pytd.py

This module also defines a visitor interface which works over immutable trees,
replacing a node with a new instance if any of its fields have changed. See the
documentation in the various visitor methods below for details.

For examples of visitors, see pytd/visitors.py

    You can pass a visitor, and callback functions on that visitor will be
    called for all nodes in the tree. Note that nodes are also allowed to
    be stored in lists and as the values of dictionaries, as long as these
    lists/dictionaries are stored in the named fields of the Node class.
    It's possible to overload the Visit function on Nodes, to do your own
    processing.

    Arguments:
      visitor: An instance of a visitor for this tree. For every node type you
        want to transform, this visitor implements a "Visit<Classname>"
        function named after the class of the node this function should
        target. Note that <Classname> is the *actual* class of the node, so
        if you subclass a Node class, visitors for the superclasses will *not*
        be triggered anymore. Also, visitor callbacks are only triggered
        for subclasses of Node.
      *args: Passed to the visitor callback.
      **kwargs: Passed to the visitor callback.

  This will iterate over all children of this node, and also process certain
  things that are not nodes. The latter are either tuples, which will have their
  elements visited, or primitive types, which will be returned as-is.

  Args:
    node: The node to transform. Either an actual instance of Node, or a
          tuple found while scanning a node tree, or any other type (which will
          be returned unmodified).
    visitor: The visitor to apply. If this visitor has a "Visit<Name>" method,
          with <Name> the name of the Node class, a callback will be triggered,
          and the transformed version of this node will be whatever the callback
          returned.  Before calling the Visit callback, the following
          attribute(s) on the Visitor class will be populated:
            visitor.old_node: The node before the child nodes were visited.

          Additionally, if the visitor has a "Enter<Name>" method, that method
          will be called on the original node before descending into it. If
          "Enter<Name>" returns False, the visitor will not visit children of
          this node. If "Enter<name>" returns a set of field names, those field
          names will not be visited. Otherwise, "Enter<Name>" should return
          None, to indicate that nodes will be visited normally.

          "Enter<Name>" is called pre-order; "Visit<Name> and "Leave<Name>" are
          called post-order.  A counterpart to "Enter<Name>" is "Leave<Name>",
          which is intended for any clean-up that "Enter<Name>" needs (other
          than that, it's redundant, and could be combined with "Visit<Name>").
    *args: Passed to visitor callbacks.
    **kwargs: Passed to visitor callbacks.
  Returns:

     node, even if the contents are the same).
